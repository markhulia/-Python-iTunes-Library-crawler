# -Python-iTunes-Library-crawler
this project searches your iTunes library for duplicate songs. You have to provide you iTunes library XML as a parameter. 
At this stage, crawler is searching and comparing only file names, thus identical files with different names won't be recognized,
however this will be upgraded in further iterations of the application
